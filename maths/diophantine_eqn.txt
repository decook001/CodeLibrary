  for given (a,b,c), ax+by=c has a solution for some (x,y)  <->  gcd(a,b) | c 
  where a,b,c,x,y is in Z

step 1: ax+by=c has a solution for (x,y) -> gcd(a,b) | c
proof:
let d=gcd(a,b)
d|ax, d|by 
-> d|(ax+by) 
-> d|c
-> gcd(a,b) | c

step 2:  gcd(a,b) | c  ->  ax+by=c has a solution for (x,y)

let d=gcd(a,b)
according to the extended Euclidean theorem, d=ax+by for some x,y 
c=c/d*x*a+ c/d*y*b


Solutions :
if a solution (x,y) exists then there exists an infinite number of solutions
x'=x+k*lcm(a,b)
y'=y-k*lcm(a,b)
