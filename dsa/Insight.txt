String Matching 
    1. Knuth-Morris-Pratt 
        - single pattern 
    2. Aho-Corasick 
        - multiple patterns 

Flow Algorithm 

the shortest path in the graph 
1. undirected graph 
    positive - dijkstra (single-source , v*log2(e) ), floyd-warshall (all-pair,n^3) 
    negative edge - undefined 
2. directed graph - 
    positive - dijkstra(single-source, eloge), floyd-warshall (all-pair,n^3) 
    negative edge - bellman-ford(single-source,ve), floyd-warshall (all-pair,n^3) 
    negative cycle - undefined, detection by bellman-ford, floyd-warshall 
    
    
Range Minimum Query & range sum
1. Segment tree
    - time(n*2, logn), space(4n)
    - dynamic data
2. Binary Indexed Tree/ Fenwick Tree 
    - time(nlogn, logn), space(n) 
    - dynamic data 
    - only [0,r] type query 
3.Sparse Table 
    - time(nlogn, 1), space(nlogn) 
    - static data 
    
Sorting 
1. bubble sort 
    tc - n^2, sc - n 
2. Merge Sort 
3. Quick Sort
    ave nlogn
    worst n^2 (when data is sorted)
4. Count Sort

Minimum Spanning Tree
    1. Prim's Algorithm
    2. Kruskal's Algorithm

SQL JOIN 
1. A NATURAL JOIN can be an INNER join, a LEFT OUTER join, or a RIGHT OUTER join. The default is an INNER join. 
2. Natural join is an inner join based on the title & data type.
3. Join .. using ( ) is inner join quiet similar to inner join.
4. outer join is full outer join.
5. during aggregation where clause works on main relation data but having clause works on grouped data.
